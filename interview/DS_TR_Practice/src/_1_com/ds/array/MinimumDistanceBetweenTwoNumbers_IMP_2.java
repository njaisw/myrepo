/**
 * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-minimum-distance-between-two-numbers/
 * Given an unsorted array arr[] and two numbers x and y, find the minimum
 * distance between x and y in arr[]. The array might also contain duplicates.
 * You may assume that both x and y are different and present in arr[].
 * 
 * Examples: Input: arr[] = {1, 2}, x = 1, y = 2 Output: Minimum distance
 * between 1 and 2 is 1.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5}, x = 3, y = 5 Output: Minimum distance between 3 and
 * 5 is 2.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 8, 3}, x = 3, y = 6 Output:
 * Minimum distance between 3 and 6 is 4.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 3}, x = 3, y = 2 Output: Minimum
 * distance between 3 and 2 is 1.
